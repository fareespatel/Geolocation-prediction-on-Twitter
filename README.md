# Geolocation-prediction-on-Twitter
Python code + Report for predicting tweet location using a novel ensemble clustering method

In this project, I have devised an ensemble based clustering approach which is a combination of three supervised machine learning algorithms. I have used K-means clustering, support vector machines, and cosine similarity to predict the geolocation of a respective tweet obtained from Twitter streams. My results were found to be promising and performed well on the new streaming tweets.
